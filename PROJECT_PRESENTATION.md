# Statistical Epidemiology calculator

Epidemics have been common throughout history. Looking at prior epidemics and the public health policies enacted enables us to better handle future modern day epidemics. 

William Mompesson was a clergy man living in Eyam at the time of the outbreak. He convinced the town to quarantine themselves and set up a cordon-sanitaire:
 - Nobody was allowed to enter or leave the village.
 - Nobody in the village was to come into contact with an outsider.
 - Money left for supplies was soaked in vinegar and put at Mompesson's well by the Eyam Boundary Stone. 

These practices provide unique insight into disease handling in the 17th Century. 

As researchers, we are going to be looking at the 1664-65 Eyam Plague outbreak. A detailed record of bubonic plague outbreak was compiled by William Wood in 1842. We can use these records to mathematically analyse the severity of the outbreak. 


## Plan! - Disney Ideation

The Dreamer:
 - An epidemiology calculator that can calculate things such as positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), crude mortality rate (CMR), incidence and prevalence calculations, relative risk, confidence interval limits, and chi squared tests. 
 - Input data into the function and return calculated result.
 - Have real world application and be developed into more complex tests. 
 - Teach people about disease and public health. 

The Realist:
 - Need to decide which calculation to do and something simple so people can understand it off the bat. 
 - People may perceive it as too complex and not want to start. 
 - Time constraint 
 - Are my abilities good enough?

The Critic:
 - Not created a kata before
 - Own understanding of coding may be limited so reduced to doing a simple kata.
 - Use of TDD when I am usually a BDD

 ## Reflection

What went well:
 - Had a great and supportive team, it was relaxed easy-going and created a great learning environment. 
 - Enjoyed thinking about all the possible katas we could create but had to remember MVP. 
 - Practicing TDD over BDD which was challenging at first but got the hang of it. 

 What didnt go well:
  - Completing 300 points worth of katas, very time consuming. 
  - trying not to make this too complex so I can reach my MVP
