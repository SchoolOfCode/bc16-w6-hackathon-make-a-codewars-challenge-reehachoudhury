/* Welcome Researcher! 
    A detailed record of the 1664-65 plague outbreak was compiled by William Wood in 1842. We can use these records to mathematically analyse the severity of the outbreak. 

    You have been given a list of records containing the number of all deaths each year, as well as the mid-year population of the town, from 1661 to 1666. 

    Crude Mortality Rate (CMR) is standardised to represent the number of deaths per 1000 people. 

    CMR = (number of deaths per year / mid-year population) * 1000

    Create a function where if inputted with Woods records will calculate CMR during the plague as an output. During plague records:
     - 276 deaths between 1665-1666
     - Mid-year population of 350

    Here is an examples!
    
    Total deaths pre plague from 1661-4 equal to 102, therefore an average of 25.5 deaths per year. 
    
    Assuming that birth and death rates up until the start of the plague kept the population constant at aproximately 350 people (i.e. assume mid-year population = 350),the CMR pre plague should equal 72.85714285714286.

  // Good luck!
  
}

// calculateCMR(102, 350, 4)
