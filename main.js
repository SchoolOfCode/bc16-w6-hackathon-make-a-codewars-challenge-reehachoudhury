/* Welcome Researcher! 
    A detailed record of the 1664-65 plague outbreak was compiled by William Wood in 1842. We can use these records to mathematically analyse the severity of the outbreak. 

    You have been given a list of records containing the number of all deaths each year, as well as the mid-year population of the town, from 1661 to 1666. 

    Crude Mortality Rate (CMR) is standardised to represent the number of deaths per 1000 people. 

    CMR = (number of deaths per year / mid-year population) * 1000

    Create a function where if inputted with Woods records will calculate CMR as an output. 





const mortalityRateDifference (prePlagueDeaths, prePlague)

// Calculate the relative risk 
// RR =  incidence in exposed individuals / incidence in non-exposed indidviduals
